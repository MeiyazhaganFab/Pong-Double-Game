# Pong Double: Twice the Bounce, Twice the Fun!

Pong Double isn't just your average Pong gameâ€”it's Pong on steroids! With two paddles, two players, and one bouncing ball, get ready for double the chaos and double the laughter.

## Requirements

To unleash the madness of Pong Double, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

Install Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install Pygame: Simply open CMD from the cloned repo's path and chant `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Okay, maybe you don't have to chant, but it adds to the mystique.

## How to Play

1. Fire up the game by executing the `pong_double.py` file. Don't worry, it won't explode... probably.
2. Assume your paddle position:
    - Player 1 commands the left side with `W` and `S`.
    - Player 2 reigns supreme on the right side with `UP Arrow` and `DOWN Arrow`.
3. Keep the ball bouncing while trying not to lose your mind (or your paddle). Can you handle the pressure, or will you surrender to the chaos?

## Controls

- Player 1:
  - Ascend: `W`
  - Descend: `S`
  
- Player 2:
  - Rise: `UP Arrow`
  - Dive: `DOWN Arrow`
